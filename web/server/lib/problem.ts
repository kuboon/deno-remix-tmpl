/**
 * Problem Details for HTTP APIs ([RFC 9457]) — the error body every `/api/*` route answers with.
 *
 * A problem is a JSON object served as `application/problem+json`. Its standard members are
 * `type` (a URI naming the kind of problem; `about:blank` when the HTTP status says it all),
 * `title` (a short summary of that kind, the same for every occurrence), `status` (the HTTP
 * status, repeated in the body), `detail` (what went wrong this time) and `instance` (a URI for
 * this occurrence). Anything else is an extension member, e.g. `{ configured: false }`.
 *
 * Clients read `detail` for a human-readable message (see `problemMessage` in the client).
 *
 * [RFC 9457]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457
